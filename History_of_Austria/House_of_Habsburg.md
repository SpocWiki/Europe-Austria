## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> The House of Habsburg (German: Haus Habsburg [haʊs ˈhaːbsbʊrɡ] ), 
> also known as the House of Austria, 
> was one of the most powerful dynasties in the history of Europe and Western civilization. 
> They were best known for ruling vast realms throughout Europe during the Middle Ages and early modern period, 
> including the Holy Roman Empire and Spain.
>
> The house takes its name from Habsburg Castle, 
> a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland by Radbot of Klettgau, 
> who named his fortress Habsburg. 
> 
> His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding "Count of Habsburg" to his title. 
> In 1273, Count Radbot's seventh-generation descendant, Rudolph, was elected King of the Romans. 
> Taking advantage of the extinction of the Babenbergs and of his victory over Ottokar II of Bohemia at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278, 
> he appointed his sons as Dukes of Austria and moved the family's power base to Vienna, 
> where the Habsburg dynasty gained the name of "House of Austria" and ruled until 1918.
>
> The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs 
> from 1440 until their extinction in the male line in 1740, 
> and, as the Habsburg-Lorraines from 1765 until its dissolution in 1806. 
> The house also produced kings of Bohemia, Hungary, Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia, Spain, Portugal, Sicily, Lombardy-Venetia and Galicia-Lodomeria, with their respective colonies; 
> rulers of several principalities in the Low Countries and Italy; 
> numerous prince-bishoprics in the Holy Roman Empire, 
> and in the 19th century, emperors of Austria and of Austria-Hungary, 
> as well as one emperor of Mexico. 
> 
> The family split several times into parallel branches, 
> most consequentially in the 16th century between its Spanish and German-Austrian branches 
> following the abdication of Emperor Charles V in 1556. 
> Although they ruled distinct territories, 
> the different branches nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.
>
> Members of the Habsburg family oversee the Austrian branch of 
> - the Order of the Golden Fleece, 
> - the Order of the Starry Cross and 
> - the Imperial and Royal Order of Saint George. 
> The current head of the family is Karl von Habsburg.
