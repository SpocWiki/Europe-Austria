> A washer is a thin plate (typically disk-shaped, but sometimes square) 
> with a hole (typically in the middle) that is normally used 
> to distribute the load of a threaded fastener, such as a bolt or nut. 
> 
> Other uses are as a spacer, spring (Belleville washer, wave washer), wear pad, 
> preload indicating device, locking device, and to reduce vibration (rubber washer).
>
> Washers are usually metal or plastic. 
> High-quality bolted joints require hardened steel washers 
> to prevent the loss of pre-load due to brinelling after the torque is applied. 
> 
> Washers are also important for preventing galvanic corrosion, 
> particularly by insulating steel screws from aluminium surfaces. 
> 
> They may also be used in rotating applications, as a bearing. 
> A thrust washer is used when a rolling element bearing is not needed either from a cost-performance perspective or due to space restraints. Coatings can be used to reduce wear and friction, either by hardening the surface or by providing a solid lubricant (i.e. a self-lubricating surface).
>
> Rubber or fiber gaskets used in taps (or faucets, valves, and other piping connections) as seal against water leaks are sometimes referred to colloquially as washers; but, while they may look similar, washers and gaskets are usually designed for different functions and made differently.
