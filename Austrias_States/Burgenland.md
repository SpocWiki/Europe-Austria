> to the newly formed Republic of Austria. 
> 
> In 1921, the annexation of Burgenland was completed; 
> the newly acquired territory was given the legally binding name Burgenland 
> by the Federal Constitutional Act of 25 January 1921.

> Burgenland borders the city of Bratislava to the north, 
> the Hungarian counties of Győr-Moson-Sopron and Vas to the east, 
> the two municipalities of Kuzma and Rogašovci (Slovenia) 
> for a few kilometers to the south, 
> and the Austrian federal states of Styria and Lower Austria to the west.
> 
> The proportion of 
> permanent settlement area within the state territory amounts to 62.76%, 
> the second-highest value among Austria’s nine territorial federal states after Vienna.
> 
> Burgenland is characterized by Lake Neusiedl in the north 
> and the foothills of the Alps in the hilly south. 
> It is elongated in shape and narrows at Sieggraben 
> in the Ödenburg Mountains to a width of 4 km. 
> The region is part of the Centrope Project.
